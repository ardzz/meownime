## Installation
The recommended way to install Meownime Library is with Composer. Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and installs them into your project.
```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
You can add Meownime Library as a dependency using Composer:
```
composer require ardzz/meownime
```
Alternatively, you can specify Meownime Library as a dependency in your project's
existing composer.json file:
```json
 {
   "require": {
      "ardzz/meownime": "^1.0"
   }
}
```
After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:
```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";
```
You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and other best-practices for defining dependencies at getcomposer.org.
